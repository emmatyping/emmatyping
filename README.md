Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ethan!

I am a passionate open source developer with a love of programming languages, type theory, and WebAssembly! My current interests are in Python, Rust, JITs, type systems and quantum computers! I also enjoy tinkering with microcontrollers and Raspberry Pis.

In my open source work, I am a core developer on the mypy project, and a contributor to CPython, focusing on porting Python to the web.
