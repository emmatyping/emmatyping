Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emma!

I am a passionate open source developer with a love of programming languages/type theory, data compression, packaging, and WebAssembly!

In my open source work, I am a CPython triager and mypy core developer. I've also authored multiple accepted Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs):
- [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) describes how to distribute types in Python packages
- [PEP 784](https://peps.python.org/pep-0784/) adds Zstandard compression to the Python standard library

Check out my [OSS TODO list](https://notes.emmatyping.dev/share/ossTODO) to see what I am thinking of working on right now.
